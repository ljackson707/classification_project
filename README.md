# classification_project
This is a repo for the classification project using telcom data.


# Audience

    - Your target audience for your notebook walkthrough is the Codeup Data Science team. This should guide your language and level of explanations in your walkthrough.


# Deliverables

You are expected to deliver the following:

    - a Jupyter Notebook Report showing process and analysis with the goal of finding drivers for customer churn. This notebook should be commented and documented well enough to be read like a report or walked through as a presentation.

    - a README.md file containing the project description with goals, a data dictionary, project planning (lay out your process through the data science pipeline), instructions or an explanation of how someone else can recreate your project and findings (What would someone need to be able to recreate your project on their own?), key findings, recommendations, and takeaways from your project.

    - a CSV file with customer_id, probability of churn, and prediction of churn. (1=churn, 0=not_churn)

    - individual modules, .py files, that hold your functions to acquire and prepare your data.

    - a notebook walkthrough presentation with a high-level overview of your project (5 minutes max). You should be prepared to answer follow-up questions about your code, process, tests, model, and findings.


# What are we looking for? 

Example Problems: 

    - Are the variables FiberOptic and high Monthly charges a significant factor to churn?

    - Are the bariables having online security and paperless billing causing churn?

    -  For Males who stream movies, is there a diffrence in age for those who churn?
